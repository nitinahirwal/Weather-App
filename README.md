# Weather-App

A weather app is a software application that provides users with information about the current and forecasted weather conditions for a specific location. Weather apps typically allow users to input a location, and then retrieve and display data such as the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. Some weather apps also provide additional features, such as alerts for severe weather conditions, hourly or daily forecasts, and detailed information about specific weather phenomena (such as cloud cover or air pressure). Weather apps can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as planning outdoor activities, deciding what to wear, and staying informed about potential hazards in your area. Many weather apps are available for smartphones, tablets, and other devices, making it easy to access weather information on the go.
